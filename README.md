# boat-racing-game

A simple boat racing game, which resembles to that of a snake and ladder game, where first player who reaches the 100th tile wins. This project was developed using Java programming language. A die is implemented and designed to generate numbers randomly which determines the number of tiles for players to move forward in the river. Traps and currents are scattered randomly across the river, whereby currents push the players forward and traps pull the players backward. The traps and currents are of varying sizes and carries a different value. The first player who lands on the 100th tile automatically wins the game. 

Additionally, a live leaderboard is also implemented to display the top 3 players with the highest score. Players can earn their ranks with the lowest number of attempts possible. Difficulty levels can be selected by users to increase the number of traps and currents as well.
